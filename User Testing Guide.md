# Build Script Guide


Introduction - Thank for helping us today. Just so you know, some of my teamates will be observing the session today from a seperate location, they're viewing the screen on our testing device and can hear your voice, so won't be a distraction. My name is Leo, I’m a developer on the application, the application we're working on is a educational video streaming platform for web developers.


Explanation - I’d like to show you the application first. (show them home page) I’m going to give you a few tasks to do from the our home page. It's a very free exercise so there are no right or wrong ways of doing things, this is not about you getting something wrong or right, we're looking to learn about the application. So that we know how you're finding it, we want you to talk aloud whatever you're thinking. So as you explore it, tell us anything that comes into your mind.


Task 1 - The first task I’d like you to do is to signup/login the app, whenever your ready please begin.
Task 2 - Thank you, next task I'd like you to do is add a course to your profile page.
Task 3 -  Begin streaming the course. 
Task 4 - Take a note within the video that you are watching.


Afterwards - How did you find using the application? Did anything stick out for you that you’d like to share?


Wrap Up - May I ask you a few additional questions about yourself?


- What is your occupation?
- Do you use apps often?
- Have you used similar apps before?
- Do you have any questions for me?


Thanks - The session is now complete, I’d like to thank you for the help you’ve given us to improve our application.
